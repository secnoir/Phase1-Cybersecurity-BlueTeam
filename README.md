Phase 1 - Foundations (Blue Team)

Building my base for cybersecurity.
This repo has all my blue team labs, notes, and small projects while I go through the first phase of my training (Linux, networking, scripting, packet analysis, etc).

Goal

I’m using this repo to track my progress and prove I can actually do things, not just study them.
Each week I’ll post labs, commands I used, screenshots or pcaps, and a short report.

Learning targets

Get comfortable with Linux commands and system basics

Understand TCP/IP, ports, routing, subnetting, firewalls

Write small Python or Bash scripts to automate stuff

Use Wireshark, Nmap, Netcat, tcpdump

Do basic log and packet analysis like a junior SOC analyst

Build a small home lab and upload reports on GitHub
