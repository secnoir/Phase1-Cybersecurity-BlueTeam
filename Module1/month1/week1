This week was all about learning:
Where attackers hide 
Which directories matter for investigation
And become fast at navigating and inspecting 

Some critical directories are:
/etc/
/var/log/
/usr/bin
/home
/usr/sbin
/tmp
/var/tmp
/root

Commands i learned :
ls -la   #To see all files including hidden ones in a directory
du -sh *  #This shows disk usage
find / -perm 4000  #This detects the SUID binaries , SUID binaries are special type of file that lets a user run something with owner's permission
cd  #This is used to navigate through the system
cd ~ #It takes you to the home directory
cd / #Takes you to whatever directory you enter
pwd #Shows where you are
